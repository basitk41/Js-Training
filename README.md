# Instruction:
=> clone the repo<br />
=> make branch with your own name<br />
=> do the tasks one by one, if any problem, any question, any suggestion, most welcome every time.<br />
=> at the end of this course you will have your own javascript self written book with all examples and exercises solved by self.<br />
=> you will need to write a short definition of each topic and then solve examples for that topic.<br />
